# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)



# User.create(name: "Nadia", username: "nadiaf", password: "password", hometown_id: 1)

# anaheim = Location.create(city: "Anaheim", state: "California", country: "USA")
# disney = anaheim.attractions.create(name: "Disneyland", description: "Happiest place on Earth!")
# disney = Attraction.first

# nadia = User.first
# nadia_disney = nadia.trips.create!(start_date: "2022-06-01", end_date: "2022-06-08")

# nadia_disney.visits.create!(attraction: disney, date: "2022-06-01")
# nadia.comments.create!(content: "Fun for all", attraction: disney)
